        <p>Hi! I'm Jamil Uddin. I currently study full-time as a Programming C# .Net Developer, Lexicon AB, Stockholm, Sweden. I like to make open source projects for fun; all of which can be found on GitHub. This is my personal website where I share everything I know.

            I like to read books and play badminton & football As a person, I am active, positive, social and thinking outside of the box is natural. I like to meet cool people.
